# Parallel QuickSort with OpenMP

Parallel QuickSort with OpenMP is a C implementation of the QuickSort algorithm, enhanced with OpenMP directives to achieve parallel execution. This project demonstrates how parallel computing can significantly improve the performance of sorting algorithms, especially when handling large datasets.

### Features
- Parallel QuickSort Implementation: Utilizes OpenMP to parallelize the QuickSort algorithm, reducing execution time on multi-core processors.
- Performance Measurement: Includes functionality to measure and display the execution time, highlighting the efficiency gains from parallelization.

### Project Structure
- ```OpenMPQiuckSort.c```: Contains the implementation of the parallel QuickSort algorithm using OpenMP.
- ```Group Assignment report.pdf```: Provides detailed documentation and analysis of the project.
